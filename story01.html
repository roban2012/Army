THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, PRC, is pursuing a long-term, comprehensive military modernization program designed to improve the capacity of China’s armed forces to fight and win “local wars under conditions of informatization,” or high-intensity, information-centric regional military operations 操作，经营；手术；运算；作战 of short duration. China’s leaders view modernization of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as an essential component of their strategy to take advantage of what they perceive to be a “window of strategic opportunity” to advance China’s national development during the !rst two decades of the 21st century. During this period, China’s leaders are placing a priority on fostering a positive external environment to provide the PRC with the strategic space to focus on economic growth and development. 韬光养晦<br><br>

At the same time, Chinese leaders seek to maintain peace and stability along their country’s periphery外围, expand their diplomatic influence to facilitate 促进 access to markets, capital, and resources, and avoid direct confrontation with the United States and other countries. This strategy has led to an expansion of China’s presence in regions all over the world, creating new and expanding economic and diplomatic interests.<br><br>

As these interests have grown, and as China has assumed  取得（权力）；承担，担任；假设 new roles and responsibilities in the international community, China’s military modernization is, to an increasing extent, focusing on investments in military capabilities that would enable China’s armed forces to conduct a wide range of missions, including those farther from China. Even as the PLA is contending 争夺；竞争；奋斗 声称，主张；争论 with this growing array of missions, preparing for contingencies 意外事故 in the Taiwan Strait remains the principal focus and driver of much of China’s military investment.<br><br>

In this context, over the past year, the PLA continued to build the capabilities and develop the doctrine it considers necessary to deter 阻止，威慑 Taiwan from declaring independence; to deter, delay, and deny effective U.S. intervention in a potential cross-Strait conflict; and to defeat Taiwan forces in the event of hostilities.<br><br>


To support the PLA’s expanding set of roles and missions, China’s leaders in 2011 sustained investment in advanced cruise巡航 missiles导弹, short and medium range conventional ballistic弹道 missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles, counterpace weapons, and military cyberspace capabilities which appear designed to enable anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) 封锁/反封锁 missions, or what PLA strategists refer to as “counter intervention operations.” <br><br>

The PLA also continued to demonstrate improved capabilities in advanced fighter aircraft, as evidenced by the inaugural 就任的；创始的 fight testing of the J-20 stealth fighter 隐身战机; limited power projection武装力量投送, with the launch of China’s First aircraft carrier for sea trials; integrated air defenses; undersea warfare; nuclear deterrence and strategic strike 打击; improved command and control; and more sophisticated training and exercises across China’s air, naval, and land forces.<br><br>

Underscoring the extent to which China’s leaders are increasingly looking to the PLA to perform missions that go beyond China’s immediate 最接近的；目前的 territorial concerns, over the past year the PLA deployed assets to support non-combatant evacuation operations from Libya, extended its presence 出席 in the Gulf of Aden for a third year of counterpiracy 反海盗 operations, took on leadership roles in United Nations peace operations, and conducted medical exchanges and a service mission to Latin America and the Caribbean using the PLA Navy’s hospital ship. 苏联派导弹，中国医疗船<br><br>

During their January 2011 summit, President Barack Obama and China’s President Hu Jintao committed to work together to build a cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual beneft. Within that framework, the U.S. Department of Defense seeks to build a military-to-military relationship with China that is healthy, stable, reliable, and continuous.<br><br>

Strengthening the U.S.-China military-to-military relationship is a part of shaping China’s choices by encouraging it to cooperate with the United States and its allies and partners in the delivery of international public goods, including in such endeavors as counterpiracy, international peacekeeping, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. As the United States builds a stronger foundation for a military-tomilitary relationship with China, it also will continue to monitor China’s evolving military strategy, doctrine, and force development. In concert with Allies and partners, the United States will continue adapting its forces, posture 姿势；看法； 态度；立场, and operational concepts to maintain a stable and secure Asia-Pacific security environment.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">Chinese Military Strategy And Doctrine</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
Overview<br><br>

China’s leaders view the first two decades of the 21st century as a “period of strategic opportunity” for China’s growth and development. They assess that this period will include a generally favorable external environment, characterized by interdependence, cooperation, and a low threat of major power war. They believe this provides China a unique opportunity to focus on internal development while avoiding direct confrontation with the United States and other great powers. China’s leaders do not expect this period to be free of tension or competition (as evidenced by periodic flare-ups 闪光；爆发 with neighbors over territorial disputes in the South China Sea) or to last indefinitely. 韬光养晦<br><br>

China’s foreign and security policies remain aimed largely at taking advantage of and prolonging this window of opportunity. To do this, Beijing seeks to emphasize positive relations with neighbors and constructive engagement in
international affairs, key components of what Beijing calls its “peaceful development path.” 宣传口号 In a December 2010 essay on China’s foreign policy strategy, PRC State Councilor Dai Bingguo characterized peaceful development as China’s “basic state policy and strategic choice” and claimed that China’s “biggest strategic intention” is to improve the lives of its people. 信不信由你<br><br>

engagement：官方翻译是“接触政策”。但查了很多词典，并参考《铁娘子》电影中撒切尔Thatcher的部属在马岛战争指挥部所言“engage them”（与他们交战）。所以，美国的外交政策时与中国作战（保持接触）。希拉里任上提出rebalance（再平衡），我国非常不爽。但比美国右派的engagement（交战）还是要温和和多。<br><br>

China’s Strategic Objectives <br><br>

Within this context, China pursues a set of overriding strategic objectives that have remained fairly consistent 一致的；一贯的 over the past decade. These objectives include preserving 保护；保持 Communist Party rule 统治, sustaining economic growth and development, defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity, achieving national unification, maintaining internal stability, and securing China’s status as a great power.<br><br>

With its growing power and international status, China periodically acts more assertively in pursuit of its strategic priorities, while also seeking to take advantage of a favorable external environment to pursue economic and military modernization goals.<br><br>

Beijing is finding it increasingly dificult to balance these interests, particularly when the pursuit of one confiicts with the pursuit of another. For example, although defending territorial claims allows China to display firmness on sovereigntyrelated issues, Beijing must balance such behavior against the need to avoid a backlash 反击；激烈反应 among neighboring countries that could undermine the stable external environment on which Beijing depends for domestic development. 多目标，最值不收敛<br><br>

China’s Military Strategy<br><br>

To advance its broader strategic objectives and self-proclaimed “core interests,” China is pursuing a robust and systematic military modernization program. In 2011, Taiwan remained the PLA’s most critical potential mission, and
the PLA continued to build the capabilities and develop the doctrine necessary to deter the island from asserting its sovereignty; deter, disrupt, or deny effective third-party (including U.S.) intervention in a potential cross-Strait
conflict; and defeat Taiwan forces in the event of hostilities.<br><br>

The PLA’s modernization efforts focus primarily on building a force capable of fighting and winning “local wars under conditions of informatization” ― conditions in which modern military forces use advanced computer systems,  information technology, and communication networks to gain operational advantage over an opponent对手；敌手.<br><br>

The character used for “local war” can also be translated as “regional war.” There is a debate over which translation is more accurate. In the course of developing, refining, and assimilating these technologies, the basic tenets 原则；信条；教义 of China’s military strategy and war fighting doctrine have displayed strong continuity. The PLA in turn has ensured that its information technologies have been developed, refined, and integrated to ensure continuity with China’s military strategy.<br><br>

China’s “Military Strategic Guidelines for the New Period,” completed in 1993 and revised as recently as 2004, contains the overarching 总的 strategic and operational guidance that directs the training, development, and employment of China’s armed forces. The key operational component 成分；零件 of these guidelines is known as “active defense,” which serves as the highest-level operational guidance to all PLA services on how to fight and win wars. The war fighting principles embedded in active defense emphasize using precise and well-timed offensive operations, gaining and retaining the initiative 主动；倡议；初步的, attacking only under favorable conditions, and exploiting an opponent’s most vulnerable weaknesses.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">The New Historic Missions</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
The PLA is expanding its participation in military operations other than war, consistent with President and Central Military Commission Chairman Hu Jintao’s Christmas Eve 2004 statement to the armed forces, where he outlined a set of “new historic missions” for the PLA. This mission statement calls on the PLA to protect China’s expanding national interests and adopt a larger role in promoting international peace and security. The “non-war” operations associated
with these missions include counter-piracy and counter-terrorism operations, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR), UN peacekeeping, sea lanes 航道，空中走廊 protection, and securing space-based assets.<br><br>

In 2011, the PLA participated in various nonwar operations. Among them, in February- March 2011, China evacuated approximately 36,000 Chinese nationals from Libya during the uprisings against Muammar Gaddafi. Though the majority of evacuees 撤离者  were moved via commercial aircraft, ships, and buses, the guided missile frigate 护卫舰 Xuzhou and four IL-76 transport aircraft were also involved.<br><br>

In April 2011, the first PLA officer (a major general) to be appointed as military leader of a UN Peacekeeping Force completed a three-and one- half-year assignment with the UN Mission for the Referendum 全民公决  in Western Sahara. In February  2011, the second PLA officer to assume such a position commanded the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. As of December 2011, China had more than 1,850 military personnel and observers deployed to 10 of the UN’s 15 peacekeeping missions.<br><br>

From late October through November 2011, the PLA Navy’s ANWEI-class Peace Ark hospital ship conducted a medical exchange and service mission, including stops in Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica. <br><br>

In November 2011, China’s Ministry of National Defense co-chaired (with Vietnam) the first ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus (ADMM+) Experts Working Group meeting on HA/DR - one of five topics selected for enhanced regional collaboration by defense ministers at the (ADMM+) in October 2010.<br><br>

In December 2011, the PLA Navy deployed its tenth task force to the Gulf of Aden in support of ongoing international counter-piracy efforts.<br><br>

China’s long-term, comprehensive military modernization is improving the PLA’s capacity to conduct high-intensity, regional military operations, including counter-intervention operations.<br><br>

For China, “counter-intervention” refers to a set of operationally-defined tasks designed to prevent foreign (e.g., U.S.) military forces from intervening in a conflict and preventing China from accomplishing its military objectives. China employs anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) 封锁/反封锁 weapons in support of this broader counter-intervention strategy C a strategy not bound by a set geographic area or domain.<br><br>

Consistent with a near-term focus on Taiwan Strait contingencies, China bases many of its most advanced systems in the military regions (MRs) opposite Taiwan. Although China could employ these capabilities for a variety of regional crisis or conflict scenarios, China has made less progress on capabilities that extend global reach or power projection武装力量投送. Outside of peacetime counter-piracy missions, for example, the PLA Navy has little operational experience beyond regional waters. Although the PLA’s new roles and missions in the international domain, like counter-piracy, reflect China’s expanding set of interests, regional contingencies continue to dominate resources and planning <a href="pic08.html">(China’s Import Transit Routes, Appendix IV, Figure 5)</a>.<br><br>

Ballistic and Cruise Missiles. China continues investments in its land-based ballistic and cruise missile programs. It is developing several variants 多样的 of offensive missiles, upgrading older systems, forming additional units, and developing methods to counter ballistic missile defenses.<br><br>

The PLA is acquiring large numbers of highly accurate, domestically built cruise missiles, and has previously acquired large numbers of Russian ones. These include the domestically produced, ground-launched CJ-10 land-attack cruise missile (LACM); the domestically produced ground- and ship-launched YJ-62 anti-ship cruise missile (ASCM); the Russian SS-N-22/SUNBURN supersonic 超音速的 ASCM, which is fitted on China’s SOVREMENNY-class guided missile destroyers; and the Russian SS-N-27B/SIZZLER supersonic ASCM on China’s Russian-built KILO-class diesel-powered attack submarines.<br><br>

By October 2011, the PLA had deployed between 1,000 and 1,200 SRBM to units opposite Taiwan. In the past year, China has fielded new SRBM systems, added additional missile brigades 旅 in southeastern China, and upgraded the lethality 致命性，毁坏性 of its existing SRBM force by introducing variants with improved ranges, accuracies, and payloads.<br><br>

During comments to the media in 2011, China confirmed it is developing an anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM), based on a variant of the DF-21 (CSS-5) medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). Known as the DF-21D (CSS-5 Mod 5), this missile is intended to provide the PLA the capability to attack large ships, particularly aircraft carriers, in the western Pacific Ocean. The assessed range of the DF-21D exceeds 1,500 km, and the missile is armed with a maneuverable warhead 容易操作的，有机动性的.<br><br>

Since the 1990s, the PLA Navy has transformed from a large fleet of singlemission platforms to a leaner force equipped with more modern, multi-mission platforms. In contrast to the fleet of just a decade ago, many PLA Navy combatants are equipped with advanced area air-defense systems, modern ASCMs, and torpedoes 鱼雷. These capabilities not only increase the lethality 致命性，毁坏性 of PLA Navy platforms, particularly in the area of anti-surface warfare, but also enable them to operate beyond the range of land-based air cover.<br><br>

The PLA Navy possesses some 79 principal surface combatants (destroyers 驱逐舰 and frigates护卫舰), 50 submarines, 51 amphibious 两栖的 and medium landing ships, and 86 missile-equipped patrol craft. The PLA Navy has now completed construction of a major naval base at Yalong, on the southernmost tip of Hainan Island. The base is large enough to accommodate a mix of nuclear-powered attack and ballistic-missile submarines and advanced surface combatants, including aircraft carriers. Submarine tunnel 隧道 facilities at the base could also enable deployments from this facility with reduced risk of detection.<br><br>

China’s aircraft carrier research and development program includes renovation of the KUZNETSOV-class aircraft carrier Hull 2 (formerly the Varyag), which began sea trials in 2011. It will likely serve initially as a training and evaluation platform. Once China deploys aircraft capable of operating from a carrier, it should offer a limited capability for carrier-based air operations. Some components of China’s first indigenously-produced carrier may already be under construction; that carrier could achieve operational capability after 2015. China likely will build multiple aircraft carriers and associated support ships over the next decade.<br><br>

China currently has a land-based training program for carrier pilots; however, it will still take several additional years for China to achieve a minimal 最小的 level of combat capability for its aircraft carriers. The PLA Navy is improving its long-range surveillance 监视 capability with sky-wave and surfacewave over-the-horizon (OTH) radars. In combination with early-warning aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other surveillance 监视 and reconnaissance 侦察或观测 equipment, the radars allow China to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance over the western Pacific. These radars can be used in conjunction with reconnaissance satellites to locate targets at great distances from China, thereby supporting long-range precision strikes, including employment of ASBMs. 那么，航空母舰战斗群将暴露在中国火力之下。<br><br>

China has developed torpedo and mine systems capable of area denial 封锁 in a Taiwan scenario. Estimates of China’s naval mine inventory exceed 50,000 mines, with many more capable systems developed in the past 10 years.<br><br>

China is producing a new class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN). The JIN-class SSBN (Type-094) will eventually carry the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile with an estimated range of some 7,400km. The JIN-class SSBN and the JL-2 will give the PLA Navy its first credible sea-based nuclear capability. The JL-2 program has faced repeated delays, but may reach initial operating capability within the next two years. 核二次打击能力还在建设中。<br><br>

China has expanded its force of nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSN). Two secondgeneration SHANG-class (Type-093) SSNs are already in service and as many as five thirdgeneration SSNs will be added in the coming years. When complete, the new class of SSNs will incorporate better quieting technology, improving China’s capability to conduct a range of missions from surveillance to the interdiction 禁止 of surface vessels with torpedoes and ASCMs.<br><br>

The current mainstay 柱石；骨干 of modern diesel  柴油机 powered attack submarines (SS) in the PLA Navy submarine force are the 13 SONG-class (Type-039) units. Each can carry the YJ-82 ASCM. The follow-on to the SONG is the YUAN-class (a Type-039 variant), as many as four of which are already in service. The YUAN-class probably includes an air-independent power system.<br><br>

The SONG, YUAN, SHANG and the still-to-be-deployed new SSN-class all will eventually be capable of launching a new long-range ASCM.<br><br>

China has deployed approximately 60 of its HOUBEI-class (Type-022) wave-piercing catamaran 双体船- hull guided missile patrol craft. Each boat can carry up to eight YJ-83 ASCMs. These boats have increased the PLA Navy’s littoral 沿海 warfare capabilities.<br><br>

The PLA Navy has acquired modern, domestically-produced surface combatants. These include at least two LUYANG II-class (Type-052C) guided missile destroyers (DDG) fitted with the indigenous 固有的；本地的 HHQ-9 long-range SAM, with additional hulls 船体 under construction; two LUZHOU-class (Type-051C) DDGs equipped with the Russian SA-N-20 long-range SAM; and at least nine JIANGKAI II-class (Type-054A) guided-missile frigates, fitted with the mediumrange HHQ-16 vertically launched SAM. These ships improve the PLA Navy’s area air defense capability significantly, which will be critical as the PLA Navy expands its operations into areas beyond the range of shore-based air defense.<br><br>

Newer and more advanced aircraft make up a growing percentage of the inventory.<br><br>

The January 2011 flight test of China’s next-generation fighter prototype, the J-20, highlights China’s ambition to produce a fighter aircraft that incorporates stealth attributes, advanced avionics 航空电子设备, and supercruise-capable engines. 

China is upgrading its B-6 bomber fleet (originally adapted from the Soviet Tu-16 BADGER) with a new, longer-range variant that will be armed with a new long-range cruise missile.<br><br>

The PLA Air Force has continued expanding its inventory of long-range, advanced SAM systems and now possesses one of the largest such forces in the world. Over the past five years, China has acquired multiple S-300 battalions 部队, the most advanced SAM system that Russia exports. It has also introduced the indigenously designed HQ-9.<br><br>

China’s aviation industry is developing several types of airborne 飞机载的 early warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft. These include the Y-8 MOTH and the KJ-2000, based on a modified Russian IL-76 airframe.<br><br>

The PLA has about 1.25 million ground force personnel, roughly 400,000 of whom are based in the three MRs opposite Taiwan. China continues to gradually modernize its large ground force. Much of the observed upgrade activity has occurred in units with the potential to be involved in a Taiwan contingency. Examples of ground unit modernization
include the Type-99 third-generation main battle tank, a new-generation amphibious assault vehicle, and a series of multiple rocket launch systems.<br><br>

China’s nuclear arsenal currently consists of about 50-75 silo-based 发射井, liquid-fueled and road-mobile, solid-fueled ICBMs. This force is complemented by liquid-fueled, intermediate-range ballistic missiles and road-mobile, solid-fueled MRBMs for regional deterrence missions. By 2015, China’s nuclear forces will include additional CSS-10 Mod 2s, enhanced CSS-4s and likely JL-2’s. The first two JIN-class SSBNs are in operational service, but the associated JL-2 SLBM continues to undergo flight testing. The JIN-class/JL-2 combination may be operational within the next two years.<br><br>

China continues work on technologies to counter U.S. and other countries’ ballistic missile defense systems as well as development of training and operating procedures that augment technological developments. Together, they strengthen China’s nuclear force and enhance its strategic strike capabilities.<br><br>


Beijing’s official policy toward the role of nuclear weapons remains unchanged and focuses on maintaining a nuclear force structure able to survive an attack and respond with sufficient strength to inflict 承受，遭受；给予（打击等） unacceptable damage on the enemy. The new generation of mobile missiles is intended to ensure the viability of China’s strategic deterrent in the face of continued missile defense advances in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Russia.<br><br>

Beijing’s “no-first-use” (NFU) nuclear policy remains unchanged: “China will not be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstance, and unequivocally 清楚明白地 commits that under no circumstances will it use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear weapon states or nuclear weapon free zones.” There has been no clarification of the ambiguity regarding the conditions under which China’s NFU policy might not apply or where
conditional nuclear threats might be permissible 许可的. 犹如律师辩论，忠于委托人利益而非事实。<br><br>

Beijing will continue to invest considerable resources to maintain a limited nuclear force, also referred to by some Chinese writers as “sufficient and effective,” to ensure that the PLA can deliver a damaging retaliatory 报复的 nuclear strike response (<a href="pic09.html">Medium and Intercontinental Range Ballistic MissilesAppendix IV, Figure 7</a>).<br><br>


Figure 7: Medium and Intercontinental Range Ballistic Missiles. China is capable of targeting its nuclear forces throughout the region and most of the world, including the continental United States. Newer systems, such as the DF-31, DF-31A, and JL-2, will give China a more survivable nuclear force. 两弹一星。<br><br>

The introduction of more mobile systems will create new command and control challenges for China’s leadership, which now confronts a different set of variables related to deployment and release authorities. For example, the PLA Navy has only a limited capacity to communicate with submarines at sea, and the PLA Navy has no experience in managing an SSBN fleet that performs strategic patrols with live nuclear warheads mated to missiles. Landbased mobile missiles may face similar command and control challenges in wartime. 系统工程。<br><br>

中国鹰派（Hawk）声音洪大，鸽派（Dove）默默无闻。其实，鹰派（Hawk）就是走零和博弈的霸道（义）；鸽派（Dove）讲究沟通和交换的王道（仁）。一个黑脸（狮子），一个白脸（狐狸）。一个打，一个谈。其实，不管什么集团都是首先为自己谋利益的，然后才为了国家谋利益。高手往往能够王霸互用；2B通常一条道走到黑。阴阳调燮，关键是分寸适度，收放自如。无论如何，我们是玩Hardball，不能绥靖（Appeasement）的。<br><br>

中国的国防和外交政策，早有定论。最近舆论开放，有各种不同声音。先前有不高兴，然后是狼图腾，最近又有人提出美国搞“C形包围”，从日本到菲律宾到马来西亚、缅甸到印度，到阿富汗，仿佛要封堵中国的出海口。如果C形包围真的存在，那么美国必须像当年中国一样修长城（国家测绘局明代长城为8851.8公里）。C形包围弯弯曲曲，长度超过2万公里（地球周长的一半），不管用什么高科技都很难守得住的吧？历史也证明了这一点：<br><br>

1、	中国长城不断被北方游牧民族攻破，举不胜举。不过，如此浩大的工程的确是大肥缺。<br><br>
2、	近代有名的还有马其诺防线（Maginot Line）、巴列夫防线（Bar Lev Line，赎罪日战争，Yom Kippur War），都惨败而终。<br><br>
3、	不用防线而获胜的例子有很多。比如：拿破仑兵败莫斯科（Kutuzov），诺曼底登陆，中国红军游击战等。关键在维持有生力量。<br><br> 
4、	罗马帝国因过度扩张而导致崩溃，这一点奥巴马早就研究明白了。美国小左希拉里来搞再平衡（Rebalance），只是抢钱。右派的接触政策（Engagement）才是要命的。<br><br>

 engagement：官方翻译是“接触政策”。但查了很多词典，并参考《铁娘子》电影中撒切尔Thatcher的部属在马岛战争指挥部所言“engage them”（与他们交战）。所以，美国的外交政策时与中国作战（保持接触）。希拉里任上提出rebalance（再平衡），我国非常不爽。但比美国右派的engagement（交战）还是要温和和多。<br><br>


中国人喜欢长城，将心比心推己及人，认为美国也喜欢长城。如果美国一定要建长城，我们不妨促而进之，让国防成本压垮丫挺的。或者，美国为了平衡预算，变本加厉地掠夺昔日的盟友，众叛亲离。就像美国里根（Reagan）政府曾经用星球大战拖垮苏联一样。<br><br>

再说了，游牧和航海民族是不会考虑筑城固守的。只要保存战斗力量和抵抗意志，哪里都是他们的根据地。比如，蒙古的成吉思汗（Genghis Khan）和忽必烈（Kublai）；还有美国鹰派本来可以控制菲律宾的，但考虑到成本而最终放弃。不当家不知道柴米贵，明清两朝均在占领朝鲜和越南后退兵。<br><br>

现在想来，C形包围可能不是美国用来防中国的，而是某些人设想出来打击美国的。以前，中国的势力范围仅限于近海，现在，试图扩张到蓝海。未来五年，要做到深蓝。为了让自己保持弱者形象而博取同情，竟然炮制出一个C形包围。器具太小！<br><br>

从历史来看，中国海岸线的防守一直都非常薄弱，敌国可以轻易攻占广州、上海、天津。如果我国海军处于防守态势，美国要那个劳什子（C形包围）来干什么？进攻方不是要攻其不备吗？如迦太基（Carthage）的汉尼拔（Hannibal）打罗马，就绕道陆路进攻。另外，美国只有中国一个需要全力以赴对付的敌人吗？咱们是不是太看重自己了点？或者，夜郎自大井底之蛙？<br><br>

如果C形包围不能成立，那么中国将来如何打算呢？笔者认为，中国外交首先是和平发展。“韬光养晦”隐含“复仇”意味，它是以实力为基础，无平等、无诚信、主权高于一切、为达目的不择手段的博弈策略。采用归谬法，很容易得出“天下第一”的结论。换句话说，中国只有成为“天下第一”才能安全（获得别国尊重）。No2服从No1，符合“强食弱肉”的逻辑。但如果全世界上百个国家，个个想当No1，那怎么办？No2还要不要有尊严地活下去？天朝一统，这就是金庸小说里面的皇帝梦（千秋万代，一统江湖）。永恒仅仅存在于宗教，哲学上大都认为不可能。天下大同可能是宗教意识形态的吧？<br><br>

如果放弃了争霸世界的思想，如何安排国防预算呢？国防开支的终极目的，可以定在“让敌人无利可图”这个目标上头。砍头的事有人做，赔本的买卖没人做。原因如下：<br><br>
1、	光靠强大的武力不能实现和平崛起的目标。比如航空母舰，1941年日本海军力量绝对超过美国，又有什么用？21世纪已不能通过武力换取经济利益。<br><br>
2、	任何投资都要求回报。如果资产负债表（Balance sheet）太多坦克和大炮，迟早要利用这些资产来牟利的。比如1900年到1940年的欧洲军备进竞赛。<br><br>

国防、外交和经济可以相互配合，实现中国的和平崛起。首先，联合俄国。Mackinder的地理枢纽（Geographical Pivot）理论虽然导致纳粹德国的覆灭，但对中俄却非常有用。俄国拥有大面积的国土，中国有大量勤劳的人口。其中的问题大概是俄国一向不太可靠，这相对于欧美日本来说。中国背后的俄国，从历史文化上看，很让人不放心的。所以，还得承认美国这个大哥。<br><br>

在中俄联合（不是联盟）的基础上，结交美国。50年内，中国绝不能与美国开战。这个符合老祖宗远交近攻的策略。中美关系偶有冲突，是健康的。中美匹敌，还需要至少20年。文艺是先导，看看Kubin评论的莫言吧：语言单薄、手法老旧；缺乏思想，不敢批判。解放后中国作家不会外语，难以读懂原文，不能领会原著精神。再看看中国的教育，北京四中和黄岗中学的高考英雄到底“能”还是不能呢？中国的将军（企业家）有几个是重点高中、名牌大学毕业的？政治局的老大有几个精通外语呢（德国默克尔精通俄语，俄国普京会德语）？ 看看义务教育的课程表，再看看英国私立中学的课程表（Winchester College, Eton College & Harrow School）。<br><br>

Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview (2012)<br><br>
 Cringley: How do you know the right direction?<br><br>

 Jobs: (long pause) Ultimately it comes down to taste. It’s a matter of trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done. And then try to bring those things into what you are doing. Picasso had a saying: “Good artists copy. Great artists steal.” We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.<br><br>

 Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians. They also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world. But if it hadn’t been computer science, these people would have been doing amazing things in other fields. We all brought to this a sort of “liberal arts” air, an attitude that we wanted to pull the best that we saw into this field. You don’t get that if you are very narrow.<br><br>


要打仗，首先要有尚武精神（奥运金牌数没有用的）。中国内地的体育实在太差了，不值一评。所以，中国还没有准备好（现在敌国也不太可能打我们的）。我们不打无准备的仗！就像俾斯麦说德国不能同时与法俄开战一样，丘吉尔的判断是：谁跟美国打仗，谁就会倾家荡产。<br><br>

对于日本，中国不得不小心应对。一方水土养一方人。如果日本侵略他国或拥有核武（生化武器），中国必须联合美俄予以坚决制止。如果中日开战，务必寻求彻底毁灭日本有生力量。干掉日本之后，再与美国谈判。谈判的周筹码就是中国拥有的毁灭性攻击力量（lethal quantity）。为了生存，中国必须维持有效的毁灭性攻击力量（lethal quantity/Mutual Assured Destruction），包括但不限于战略核威慑、战略导弹和太空武器、战略核潜艇、战略生化武器。只有在中国能够与美国同归于尽的条件下，美国才会与中国谈判。中国打日本没有私利可图（没有什么资源）的。打日本也不是为了扩大生存空间（Lebensraum），实在是为民除害啊！<br><br>

日本打中国是持久战，中国打日本必须是闪电战。日本面积太小，中日距离太近。日本灭亡后，台湾自然统一。中日和平的条件是日本承认中国的大国地位并依此行事。别无他法。<br><br>

在外交领域，必须寸步不让。外交官，首先是间谍（SPY）、然后是律师（Lawyer）最后是销售（Sale）。外交官效忠于自己的祖国（委托人），不管是原告还是被告，不管有罪无罪，也不管事实真相如何，律师（外交官）只为了委托人的利益而战。外交领域，胜者为王！至于领土问题，可大可小。不服气的可以研究一下普鲁士（Prussia）的历史地图或者中国的历史地图（谭其骧）。<br><br>

20年之后，太平洋将类似古罗马时期的地中海（Mediterranean），成为兵家必争之地。中国应该走向深蓝，首先进入太平洋和北冰洋。至于印度洋，可作为下一步或仅保持威慑（没有控制太平洋，拿印度洋没用。国力有限，无论如何不能分散兵力）。2050年之前，中国还不具备挑战美国的能力。2050年后，中美应该没有必要打仗了，为什么不来一个寡头垄断（Oligopoly）呢？在生态系统里面，不能只有老虎和狮子，还有很多动植物的。一个国家，一个星球，总会有领导者的，叫一声“老板”不会死人的。同时，如果没有被领导者，领导者（统治者）也没有办法存在的。我相信，中美可以和谐相处就像Google和苹果（Apple），微软和Oracle一样。这就叫“成熟（mature）”。<br><br>

中国要成为一流大国，光靠武力是不行的。我们必须要有一流的文化、金融和贸易支持（起码达到日本或德国水平）。这时，我们需要有商业界的德雷克（Drake）。<br><br>

人恒过，然后能改，困于心，衡于虑，而后作，征于色，发于声，而后喻。入则无法家拂士，出则无敌国外患者，国恒亡。然后知生于忧患，而死于安乐也。<br><br>

目前，中国的最大危险是小轿车。小轿车能够带来方便，但前提是地广人稀，必须以车代步。而中国人口众多集中大城市，小轿车的优势根本发挥不出来。可以想象的未来是污染严重和原料短缺的问题。污染会把大家都弄死。而原材料和能源的争夺肯定会导致战争。所以，在中国还是尽可能多地发展公共交通，我们又不是很赶时间（也不向往那种个体自由）。<br><br>

另外一个就是中国浪费惊人。如果只是勤奋而不能节约，必遭天谴！到那时，自作孽不可活，没有人能救咱们的。中国人就真的成了星际蝗虫（locust）了。<br><br>

最后，加强内部管理，千万不能出现内讧（内战）。否则，惨矣。记住：团结才是力量。这个应该比较靠谱儿。Only the Paranoid Survive! <br><br>

秦亚青想搞国际关系学派，比如中国的建构主义学派。但他有自知之明，自己承认“中国学派和中国大师要代表中国的思想体系，但我没有自己的思想体系。拉小提琴仅仅技巧好不是大师，大师的著作要有高度的思想和灵感在里面。”除了形式上标新立异，内容也必须实实在在。所谓内容，就是实践结果。国际象棋中国学派在刘文哲的领导下，女子突飞猛进，立于世界强国之林（正与俄国争霸世界）。<br><br>
